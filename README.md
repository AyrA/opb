# opb
Offline Pirate Bay Browser

## About

This application allows you to browse the pirate bay offline.

## How to Download Torrents

OPB **does not** contains a torrent client.
To download torrents, you need to have a torrent client installed that registered magnet links.
Just double click on an Entry to activate the magnet link.

## Database

If you need the database, head over to https://thepiratebay.org/static/dump/csv/.
If you prefer to use the TOR network: http://uj3wazyk5u4hnvtk.onion/static/dump/csv/.

The TOR network download seems to be more stable as of now. Using normal Connections did terminate the download almost always for me.
